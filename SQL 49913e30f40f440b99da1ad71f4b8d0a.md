## What is SQL? (SiQueL or S Q L)

- Structured Query Language (It is a kind of programming language but a different kind of)
- SQL is designed for managing data in a relational database management system(RDBMS).\
- SQL is a database language. It is used for database
    - creation
    - deletion
    - fetching rows,
    - and modifying rows, etc.
- Letâ€™s say for e.g. In ola you can check your old data later on, data is stored which is called database. All things like driver, money and all that are stored.
- Database are of two types -
    - SQL based (RDBMS) - Been around for 50 years. We create tables that are connected or related logically. To handle RDBMS, SQL is used
    - NoSQL based
- SQL is a bit different type of programming language. It has 4 different types of command
    - DDL (Data Definition Language) - used for creation of database and tables creation, alteration, drop, truncate, etc.
        - CREATE - Create new database objects
        - ALTER - Modify exisiting database objects
        - DROP - Delete existing database objects
        - TRUNCATE - Remove all rows from table
    - DCL (Data Control Language) - If you give access to another developer the extent of language control
        - GRANT - Provide access rights on database
        - REVOKE - Withdraw access rights on database
    - DML (Data Manipulation Language) - ** Major focus as a data science student is here
        - INSERT - Create new rows in tables
        - UPDATE - Modify data in tables
        - DELETE - Delete Data from tables
        - SELECT - Retrieve data from tables
    - TCL (Transaction Control Language)
        - COMMIT - Save database changes and end transaction
        - ROLLBACK - Undo changes that are not committed and end transaction

- Among the most popular databases in the world (in descending order) - majority of most used databases in the world are SQL based
    - Oracle
    - MySQL
    - Microsoft SQL Server
    - PostgreSQL
    - MongoDB (NoSQL)
    - IBM Db2
    - Redis (NoSQL)
    - Elastic Search (NoSQL)
    - Microsoft Access
    - SQL Lite
    - Cassandra
    - Splunk
    - MariaDB
    - Teradata
    - Hive
    - Solr
    - HBase
    - FileMaker
    - SAP HANA
    - Amazon DynamoDB
    - SAP Adaptive Server
    - Neo4j
    - Couchbase
    - Memcached
    - Microsoft Azure SQL
- More than 80% companies use SQL making it extremely important for software industry
- Companies are moving forward with Cloud Technologies and Big Data Technologies, the software of even these techs are made taking in mind the framework of SQL

## Why SQL is important in Data Science?

- Majority of the companies have not so evolved Data ecosystem
- When you join as a Data Scientist, no data engineers are there you have to create model on existing data.  You will have to do the data extraction.
- In well organised company the data engineers team extracts data so that data science team can work on it
- Direct interaction
- SQL is so powerful, that to get initial understanding of the data. Initial set of tasks can be done using without Python
- Among data based jobs the most in demand skill is SQL (around 40% jobs require it)
- For entry level jobs around 60% cases candidata should know SQL
- Very very in demand skill (sometimes it will make you ineligible for a role)
